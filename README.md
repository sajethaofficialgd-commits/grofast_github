This is fully ready to use. You just need to replace:  
- `your-username` → your GitHub username  
- `your-repo-name` → your repository name  
- `your.email@example.com` → your email  

If you want, I can also make an **enhanced version with Python-themed emojis for each code block and section headers** to make it visually stand out more on GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
